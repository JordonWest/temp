**Object Orientation in Javascript**

We've spent quite a bit of time on Python and all of last week on Django. We're going to shift gears and move towards Javascript. If you recall, we've mentioned that once you learn one language/framework well, it's easy to translate to another class. Let's go over that here with our `Person` class:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, hometown){
    this.name = name
    this.hometown = hometown
  }

  sayHello(){
    return `${this.name} from ${this.hometown}`
  }
}

const jon = new Person('jon', 'nj')
jon.sayHello()
```

Let's break this down a little bit. We've created a `Person` class with a `constructor` function. That `constructor` function operates similarly to Python's `def __init__` where you pass in certain parameters that the class will need to know about itself. In our case, we need two parameters/properties (aka `props` for React apps): `name` and `hometown`. The `this.name = name` basically creates an instance variable, similar to Python's `self.name = name`, meaning that we can use `this.name` everywhere inside that particular instance of the class.

The `sayHello` function basically just returns your name and hometown. With that, let's move onto React.

**React**

React is a front-end framework that was developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2013. React is based on the idea of building reusable components, not templates -- this leads to mixing markup with functional logic, which previously was a no-no. (This is accomplished through React's hybrid syntax, JSX, which we will dive deeper into later.) Up to this point, separation of concerns has been largely presented as MVC. React argues that the MVC model presents a separation of technololgies, but not necessarily of concerns. React offers components as a new way of separating concerns. (see [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY) for more info)

**Create React App**

Just like we have `django admin startapp` to create new Django applications, we have a generator, `create-react-app` from Facebook which configures everything together - take a look through the [documentation](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) when you get a chance.

We've installed Node Package Manager (NPM) when we installed Node on the first day. NPX is an updated version of NPM that comes for free with NPM. Let's install a React app by running:

Windows Users: you will have to enter this command to get hot reloading (updating as files change) to work: `export CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true`. I'd uncomment/add this in your `.bashrc` so that you don't have to do it every time you start a container.

```sh
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
$ npm start
```

This generator has generated a bunch of folders and files for us. Let's break each one down:

- The `node_modules` folder holds all of our dependencies locally so we're not relying on the web being up and running. This includes Babel, ESLint, Mocha/Chai, etc
- The `public` folder has a bunch of public-facing assets like the favicon (top corner of the tab which is your company's logo)
- `src` has the main meat of all of our app, especially `index.js`. This file is loaded first and is the entrypoint for our React app:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
serviceWorker.unregister()
```

The `import React` statement contains the the core React functionality. This includes the code related to markup like you see further down the file and turning that into UI code. `import ReactDom` takes your code and actually can render that out to the page/DOM/browser. We're also relatively importing `App`, which is the file `App.js` and we're calling it into our code.

Moving onto `App.js`:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import logo from './logo.svg'
import './App.css'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

This is an example of a functional component. As of March 2019, the creators of React want to start migrating over to functional components instead of class-based components for ease of development. They have very clearly stated that both are going to exist alongside each other and you will definitely need to know both. New projects will utilize functional components and old projects (the majority of what you'll be doing in real life) will use class-based components.

This `App.js` file is bringing in React from the `react` library, the React logo from `./logo.svg`, and a CSS file. The `return` function is an example of JSX, which you can think of as the same thing as Python's Jinja2. Jinja templates are HTML with Python inside. JSX is HTML ith Javascript in it. At the beginning of React, JSX files had the `.jsx` extension (you may still see this). They quickly realized that JSX was in every single file pretty much so they made every JS file have the JSX extention and took away the `.jsx` explicitive call and made all JS files end with the `.js` extension. Since JSX is an extension of JS, the create-react-app uses Babel to compile the code for browsers.

**Our First React App**

Let's create an actual app in React that displays a button and how many times you've clicked that button. Sounds stupid? Well, tell that to the creators of [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). They cashed out and made it big.
For today, we will focus on using React Class components since they were the foundation of React for many years and will be very prevalent in legacy codebases. Let's start by rewriting `App.js` as a Class component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <p>
            Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
          </p>
          <a
            className="App-link"
            href="https://reactjs.org"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Learn React
          </a>
        </header>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

So what's changed here? Two main things to note:
- `React.Component` is a class provided by the main React package. Now our `App` inherits (i.e., `extends`) from `React.Component` (Note: some people choose to import `Component` explicity on the initial import of React: `import React, { Component } from 'react'` and extend `Component` instead of `React.Component`. Both are acceptable.)
- `render()` is the only method you _must_ define in a `React.Component` subclass. As it suggests, it should return a React element to be rendered by the DOM.

Now that we have a class component, let's gut the boilerplate code and include our button with some header text:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1> I have been clicked X times </h1>
        <button> Click me! </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Notice we've just hard-coded a placeholder `X` to represent the number of times our button has been clicked. What we really want is to actually keep track of the number of times the button is clicked, and for that, we'll need to use the concept of `state`. **State is a global Javascript object (or Python Dictionary if you still think in that way) on a particular React Component. It basically keeps track of how things are in that particular Component** (e.g., On vs. Off, Selected vs. Not Selected, number of times clicked, etc.). State is private, meaning that it's scoped within a component.

So let's add `count` to the `state` of our class component and let our component render from `this.state`:


```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    count: 0
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1> I have been clicked {this.state.count} times </h1>
        <button> Click me! </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Notice that in JSX we use curly braces to interpolate JS into our HTML (`{this.state.count}`). Similiarly, we used `{% %}` and `{{ }}` for Python templates. We should now see that we've clicked it 0 times.

Next, we want to keep track of all the times that we've actually clicked the button - how do we do this? First, we need an event handler for the button. When the button has been clicked, the event handler will update the `count` using React's class Component method `setState`, which takes an object representing what the component's updated `state` should look like. Notice that we are NOT updating the component's state directly (i.e. we are NOT doing `this.state.count = 1`) - mutating state directly can lead to odd bugs in React (you can read more [here](https://daveceddia.com/why-not-modify-react-state-directly/#:~:text=Mutating%20state%20directly%20can%20lead,its%20parent%20re%2Drenders)), so we always want to use `setState` in class components. Once we create the event handler, we can pass it to the button's `onClick` event:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    count: 0
  };

  handleButtonClick = () => {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1> I have been clicked {this.state.count} times </h1>
        <button onClick={ this.handleButtonClick }> Click me! </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Right now, our button clicker works for one button. What if we want this button functionality to be reusable? After all, that's the whole point behind React Components! **A React Component is meant to be a piece of reusable code that returns markup. Each React Component has its own own state and behaviors, and a page can consist of one or more React Components.** So let's extract this button into its own component.

First, let's copy all the code from `App.js` and put it in `src/components/ButtonComponent/ButtonComponent.js`. We will rename the class `ButtonComponent` and remove the App import:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class ButtonComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    count: 0
  };

  handleButtonClick = () => {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1> I have been clicked { this.state.count } times </h1>
        <button onClick={ this.handleButtonClick }> Click me! </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ButtonComponent;
```

Now we import this `ButtonComponent` into `App.js` and replace the previous button/click logic with our new component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ButtonComponent from './components/ButtonComponent/ButtonComponent.js';
import './App.css';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <ButtonComponent />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

You can reuse the `ButtonComponent` over and over again. Since they are separate/independent components, each one will keep track of its own state. To demonstrate this, we can spam the screen with a lot of `ButtonComponents`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ButtonComponent from './components/ButtonComponent/ButtonComponent.js';
import './App.css';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <ButtonComponent />
        <ButtonComponent />
        <ButtonComponent />
        <ButtonComponent />
        <ButtonComponent />
        <ButtonComponent />
        <ButtonComponent />
        <ButtonComponent />
        <ButtonComponent />
        <ButtonComponent />
        <ButtonComponent />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

We have a ton of buttons! But that's not very programmatic. Let's use JS to iterate over collections of components to put them out on the screen:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ButtonComponent from './components/ButtonComponent/ButtonComponent.js';
import './App.css';

class App extends React.Component {
  createButtons = () => {
    let buttons = [];
    for (let index=0; index < 100; index++) {
      buttons.push(<ButtonComponent />);
    }
    return buttons;
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        {this.createButtons()}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Nice! 100 buttons that each maintain their own state! If you open the console, you will notice that there's a warning called that each element should have a `key` prop. When you are creating an array of lots of React Components, you'll need a `key` prop to differentiate each individual component. Simply add the key to the ButtonComponent: `buttons.push(<ButtonComponent key={index} />)`

Good luck on today's challenges!
