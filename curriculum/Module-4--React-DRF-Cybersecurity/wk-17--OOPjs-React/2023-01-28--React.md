Challenges
----------
Quick note on today's challenges: `Mad Lib` has React starter code for you. When you clone the repos, be sure to run `npm install` to install all of the necessary dependencies. You will notice that the original code uses React class components -- you are welcome to refactor them into functional components if you so choose. Keep in mind that when you are keeping track of multiple state properties in a functional component, you will declare each one independently using the `useState()` hook. (So instead of having one state object with multiple properties, each piece of state will be a variable on the scope of the functional component.)
