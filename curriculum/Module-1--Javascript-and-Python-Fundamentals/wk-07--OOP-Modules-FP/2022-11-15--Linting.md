### Code Style
If you think about driving a car in the US and driving a car in Hong Kong, the experience is the same because there is a style / standard that auto manufacturers must follow in order to sell a car. The same applies to the code that you write. A California-based software engineer writing in Python will have code that looks pretty much the same as a Russian-based software engineer writing in Python because of universally adhered coding styles.

The good part about Python is that it forces proper indentation in order for a file to run. The proper indentation alone accounts for over 90% of issues that developers generally face. That being said, proper code style goes beyond proper indentation; it accounts for proper variable declaration, use of comments, etc. Luckily for us, we don't need to worry too much about those rules as the Python community has built a **linter** to notify us of errors in our Python code through [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting). Install this extension and run it whenever you write Python!

Javascript also has a built-in linter that we'll cover in more depth when we get to React called [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
